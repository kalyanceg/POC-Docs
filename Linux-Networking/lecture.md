## Target Audience

Networking and Data Communication is one of the fundamental skills of an SRE. This course is framed to cover the fundamentals of Linux Networking and practical examples of how these concepts are used by an SRE in day to day work. This course can be treated as quick refresher by already working SREs and can be skimmed faster

Throughout the journey, the course covers how an SRE can optimize the system to improve her webstack performance and troubleshoot if there is an issue in any of the layers of networking stack. This course tries to dig through each layer of traditional TCP/IP stack and expects an SRE to have a picture beyond bird’s eye view of the functioning of the Internet

## What is not covered under this training

We are not covering concepts beyond fundamentals like HTTP/2.0, QUIC, TCP congestion control protocols, Anycast, BGP, CDN, Tunnels and Multicast. We expect post this course, one has relevant basics to have a quick grasp on such concepts
